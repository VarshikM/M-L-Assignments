University Of Central Missouri Short Description: Machine Learning Assignment 1 is done completely using Jupyter Notebook. This Assignment mainly focuses on the python lists, tuples, dictionary, sets. We can create lists using square brackets[], tuples using paranthesis(), dictionaries and sets using curly brackets{}. In dictionaries items are stored as key - value pairs. There are many predefined functions in Python to access and modify lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets. In this assignment we used some geometric formulas to calculate area of circle and its circumference. Implemented KNN Classifier Algorithm and also calculated Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity.
