Short Description of Assignment 3:
Machine Learning assignment 3 is about implementing NumPy and Matplotlib. NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more. Matplotlib is a cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python and its numerical extension NumPy.
